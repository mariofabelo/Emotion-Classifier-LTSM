# Emotion-Classifier-LTSM

Compared MultinomialNB, LogisticRegression, RandomForest, SVC models and found RandomForest to obtain the highest score at predicting emotions.

Then implemented a Tensorflow Neural Network to train the model to which later apply an LSTM algorithm for approaching the natural language processing of the text into emotions.
